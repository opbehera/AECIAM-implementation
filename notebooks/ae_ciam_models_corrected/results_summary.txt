BRIEF NOTES
-----------
- Our implementation underperforms the paper's reported results for both multiclass and binary experiments (accuracy and F1-score notably lower).
- MCC values indicate reasonably good but lower correlation compared with the paper for multiclass.
- Inference time reported in the CSV is extremely small for our model and should be reviewed for measurement methodology.

If you want, I can also:
- Add this summary to the repo root or a different folder, or
- Append a short analysis section comparing per-class performance and confusion matrix stats.
